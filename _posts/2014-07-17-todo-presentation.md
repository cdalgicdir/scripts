## TO-DO
- Modeling multiscale: bond vibration in terms of time up to coarse-grain modelling
- tell about coarse-graining with a slide
- why do we need CG? give example from lit: long sim - think about amyloid fibril formation
- driving forces and mechanism to study --> MD & then what is MD, then what can be done with MD --> show multiscale (bond fluctuation time scales) -> show folded protein from literature (ubiquitin-how long it took) - protein aggregation - 100s of mols and water --> very long -- our system?
- show PBBP dihedral one by one and then xtal
- in solution show video, and timeline
- first show CG solvent, show free energy table then show FF mapping
- show PMF along with interface dih distrs.
- Do not overtune CG model (mod PC - PMFs)
- KL designed for ah, LK, charge, structure similar to FF bw, int
- isolated - single in bw KL (fig in paper) (dilute) frustrated - hydrophobic core, lysine charge, intrinsic disord.
- we showed the dramatic effect of interface in FF (only partitioning, no secondary structure) here sec str.
- link to FF molecular interface before dimer (no video for dimer-change snapshots in fig)
- link to FF and amyloid fibril formation before nKL
