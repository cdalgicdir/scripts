### Analysis of the atomistic aggregates in bulk water
- For each aggregate of n-KL where n>1:
  - SASA
  - DSSP
  - Snapshots
  - Relative orientation within the aggregate
  - ? Inter-dimer distance vs inter-dimer angle
 
### Analysis for air/water interface simulations
  - Orientation of the Leucines with respect to the interface
    (is there a slight tilt)
  - DSSP
  - Snapshots
