## To-do
1. Calculate the distributions for L-CA-CN and KC-CA-CN even though you don't explicitly give those
2. ?? L-CA-CN and KC-CA-CN (the reverse of the given angles) could be given ??
3. put charges, then put pair interxns for CN_i-CN_i+4, then leucine-leucine interxns
4. ? Generate analogue of FF case
5. ? Try double min potential that slightly favors the desired conformation

Next meeting 5 Feb 11 TR time

1. Use pair intrxn pot for C_i-C_i+4
	- How deep the intrx pot should be? (1 kT?)
2. If pair intrxns work, then replace tetramer backbone dihs w/ vacuum dihs
3. If the replacement of vac backbone dihs fail, increase the depth of CN-CN intrxn  (? try the BInv of atomistic)
