### Why does the peptide fold into helix?
-MS: Do you know any structural measure to identify the folding of the alpha
helix? I am trying to decompose the energy contributions for the helix
formation. If we measure the SASA during folding of a helix for LK, pretty
much the whole change in SASA comes from the LEU sidechains. But there must
also be a significant contribution from the backbone. I don't think h-bonds
is the answer, because even if the helix does not form, the backbone can
still make h-bonds with water. So the answer should be related to the
entropy of the water molecules. SASA should also reflect this, but when I
look at the SASA from the backbone of the molecule, there is pretty much no
change in SASA.
