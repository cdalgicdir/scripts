### TO-DO
- Intro - relate conformational transition to amyloid formation
- FF: snapshot of the crystal structure of the rodlike molecule
    - how do these aggregates oriented
    - why FF? - amyloid aggregation motifs - to understand the mechanisms behind aggregation
- Title: Environment Induced Conformational Transition in Peptides
- cis-trans conformational transition of diphenylalanine molecule
- In FF intro: introduce FF molecule and related studies
- change title for transferability of CG
- for fig 3.4 in FF, place more figs to show transitions + overall histogram
- in abstract & intro emphasize your contribution
  1. showed environment induced conformational changes
  2. CG modeled conformational changes (instead of state-dependent models)
- FF: sections for each contributions
- describe your FF model: how are atoms mapped in a table
- FF-methods section: describe TI-particle insertion
- FF: what happens when you use C/W potential : show the results
- FF: describe how you attained CG-ST - in the middle of two variables W/C and C/W so show CG-FE's surface tension-- use it as a free parameter
- Fig 3.12 remove P-C
- Fig 3.10 remove mod-P-C
- add modified version of 3.10 with both mod-P-C's and then add the 3.12 again with mod-P-C
- mod-P-C positions the molecule in correct position at the int
- although the model is structural the transition is thermodynamic 
- extend fig 3.15 with another figure and shift y value of bulk cyclohexane to zero

#### KL
- secondary amphiphilicity
- talk about all LK molecules: why are they important
- describe other LK molecules and also similar peptides
- first show dimer in bw, then n-mer. Then discuss air/water interface
