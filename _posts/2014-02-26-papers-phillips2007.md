- observed alpha helix in solution but concentration may be higher than critical level (see Notes)
- For LK$_14$ monotonic adsorption on PS surface and multistep adsorption on SiO$_2$.
- LK14 nonpolar sidechains are aligned on hydrophobic surfaces
- LK14 adopts alpha helix in solution (CD data-final page)
- LK14 maintains the helix "to some degree" upon adsorption on silica

>"...amphiphilic nature of these peptides may allow for the
>hydrophobic side chains to interact with hydrophobic polysty-
>rene surface, while the charged hydrophilic chains face the bulk
>water interface."

### ??
>The amide A band observed in the SFG spectrum indicates that
>we measure a molecular scale secondary structure interaction
>with the silica surface in contrast to the local interaction
>measured for adsorbed peptides on polystyrene.

### SEE
- 10, 27, 28: below peptide concentrations of 0.01mM, LK14 is random-coil
  - tetramer induces helical structure?
  - 25, 39: hydrophobic residues are aligned at hydrophobic surfaces

#####27: K$_2$(LA)$_x$ (x=6,8,10,12):
    x=6: adopts antiparallel beta-sheet but in lower concentrations adopts random coil, suggesting the origin of the beta-sheet structure is intermolecular.
    x=8: both alpha helix and beta sheet
    x=10,12: alpha helix dominant at all concentrations
>Since lysine residues are known to support helical structures, the 7 residues present presumably stabilize this structure at the air/water interface.(Creighton-Proteins)

### Check
- 31: aminoacids at the air-water interface
