## TO-DO
- Fig. 4.51 red peak-cg-vacBBdih-ii4p CN-CA-CN-CA dihedral, 2nd peak relates to end points -- write
- ~~nwall=2 check wall atomtype~~
- ~~change wall strength and monitor adsorption~~
- ~~measure atomistic CN-CNi+(2,3) distance distributions & compare with the CG model (cg-vacBBdih-ii4p -- no wall)~~
	- the cooperative effect of CNi-CNi4

## OUTLINE
- lysine charge
- i-i+4 --> generic
- leu-leu interaction

# TO-DO - KL-aggregate
- REMD in bw: add convergence (divide into two) for SS v T
