- all experiments performed at low peptide concentration (0.1 mg/mL)

- Adsorption behavior of LK$_14$ was tested in two different surfaces:
  - hydrophobic polystyrene (PS) surface
  - hydrophilic SiO$_2$ surface
  - 

- Surface was rougher for SiO$_2$ than that of PS.
  - rigid film on PS surface
- Adsoprtion lasted ~30 min for SiO$_2$ and less than 2 min for PS
  - From small spherical islands of ~200 nm wide to larger up to 1.5 $\mu$m in 30 min for SiO$_2$ surface
  - multiple peptide layers are formed in hydrophilic (negatively charged) SiO$_2$ surface.
  - peptide adopts different orientations at these interfaces
  - water arrangement is also different (check next paper)

- In hydrophobic PS surface, hydrophobic leucine sidechains are oriented towards the surface.
- In hydrophilic SiO$_2$ surface, hydrophilic lysine sidechains are oriented towards the surface.
