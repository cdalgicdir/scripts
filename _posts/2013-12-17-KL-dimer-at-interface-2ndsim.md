I have done the dimer again, this time starting from a parallel
configuration and the distance vs angle correlation, as well as the
histograms for the angle and distance are similar.

The main difference in correlation plot is the lack of parallel
configuration. Although I started from a parallel orientation, the molecule
switched to an anti-parallel orientation immediately and stayed that way.
(The 1st sim was 1 microseconds and the 2nd one was only 300 ns)
