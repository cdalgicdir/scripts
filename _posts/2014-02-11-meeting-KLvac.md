1. after mapping atomistic interface, calculate the position of interface using
density profiles, then measure the distance of L grains to the interface. invert to get the potential
1. smooth and fit the deepest curve for dist-CNi-CNi4 atomistic, invert and do cg sim.
1. check error analysis, block averaging for end-to-end distance of KL in vacuum (atm)
