### KLcg
1. Dihedral CN-CA-CN-CA remove the extra well, fit to a harmonic function
2. Dihedral CA-CN-CA-CN remove the extra well, fit to a harmonic function
3. Difference in dih: CA-CN-CA-KC and CA-CN-CA-L (convention?):
	- Take an atomistic minimized configuration of KL at AH and map into CG, then energy minimize mapped conf: should give similar distributions.
4.
