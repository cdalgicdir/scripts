### TO-DO
- ---Add the snapshot'd DSSP for single bulk water case.---
- Snapshot for interface dssp how it is positioned along the interface. (perpendicular to interface)
- ---for dimer in bw, remove antipar, par and aggregated EALA.---
	- option: add kl2 bw rc dssp where they are separated and then merge & fold into helix.
	- ---snapshot: no lysines, show leucines: top and side views.---
- how do these peptides in the dimer find each other: 3 snapshots: separated, merging (end point unfolded) and merged
- mindist data above dssp for dimer in bw merging
- table for sasa (put fig in supp)
