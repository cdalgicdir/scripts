### Questions
1. Why is the *basin3* more populated than other basins?
Possible answer:
- The distance between charged lysines are increased.
2. Why is *antiparallel* orientation more populated than the *parallel* orientation?

### Number of water molecules
- We should divide the trajectory into 4 and calculate an error, and then plot the results considering these error values. *error bars*
- What about the number of water mols around leu sidechains for the dimer case at the air/water interface?
- add values for the trimer and pentamer
