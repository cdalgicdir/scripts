abstract

4 paragraf

1. problem definition: not only sequence but also env dependence
we will focus on interface - macroscopic and molecular.

2. 2 model system:

FF simple system ideal to study these processes
2 results: shown environment induced conformational transition at atomistic resolution
(hardness to show)
investigate via CG model

second model is a more complex system: KL
environment dependent behavior
aggregation results in more complex systems


4. paragraph
contribution: aggregation in intrinsically disordered protein
link to neurodegenerative diseases

we showed via atomistic MD simulations the hardness of observing these processes via atomistic MD simualations.

nonbonded and bonded separation might not always work

two state model - CG model: structural or thermodynamic
conformational change seems structural but the driving forces are thermodynamic
