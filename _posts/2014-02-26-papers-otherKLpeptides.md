- amphipathic L15K7: at air/water interface
>These peptides were proved to fold mainly into an a-helix (Comut et al., 1993, 1994).
>This is particularly clear for L15K7; it was designed to be able to form an ideal amphipathic helix, and the data herein prove it behaves as a pure a-helix lying at the interface.
>It is clear that the experimental PMIRRAS spectrum of L15K7 (Fig. 4 b) favors an orientation of the a-helix parallel to the air/water interface.
