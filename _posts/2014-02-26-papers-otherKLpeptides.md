## Other K and L based peptides

- In situ study by polarization modulated Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of the structure and orientation of lipids and amphipathic peptides at the air-water interface - [Cornut](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349596795711?np=y)
- Ideally amphipathic β-sheeted peptides at interfaces: structure, orientation, affinities for lipids and hemolytic activity of (KL)mK peptides - [Castano](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005273699001753?np=y)

>These peptides were proved to fold mainly into an a-helix (Comut et al., 1993, 1994).

- amphipathic L15K7: at air/water interface
>These peptides were proved to fold mainly into an a-helix (Comut et al., 1993, 1994).
>This is particularly clear for L15K7; it was designed to be able to form an ideal amphipathic helix, and the data herein prove it behaves as a pure a-helix lying at the interface.
>It is clear that the experimental PMIRRAS spectrum of L15K7 (Fig. 4 b) favors an orientation of the a-helix parallel to the air/water interface.
