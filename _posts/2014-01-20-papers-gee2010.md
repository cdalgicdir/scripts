### Two-dimensional replica exchange approach for peptideâ€“peptide interactions
Jason Gee and M. Scott Shell [2010]

- New method: UREMD = umbrella-sampling REMD
- 2 dimensions:
    1. temperature (as in REMD)
    2. umbrella sampling coordinate between center of mass of the two peptides
- Tests the approach on two peptide families:
    1. Tetrapeptides as minimal models for amyloid fibril formation
    2. fragment of a classic leucine zipper peptide and its mutant


see 38-46 for different applications of REMD to study the dimers, trimers etc for their stability.
see Wolf et al [66] for a replica exchange approach for sampling along a peptide-peptide distance coordinate.

- Normally if one has n replicas and m US distances, then one should have $mxn$ windows. To reduce this, the US dimension is only used for the lowest temperature, and the temperature dimension is used for two US distances (namely the 2nd and the penultimate).
- allows exchanges between temperature or umbrella state neighbors or both.
- shape of PMF depends on the success of swap attempts between umbrella neighbors

Q: If US windows are swapped, eg d=2.8 configuration is swapped with d=2.6, then one should get d=2.6 configuration in d=2.8 simulation. That simulation should come to equilibration at a certain number of steps, where one should wait and lose time. How do they solve this?
