### Two-dimensional replica exchange approach for peptideâ€“peptide interactions
Jason Gee and M. Scott Shell [2010]

- New method: UREMD = umbrella-sampling REMD
- 2 dimensions:
  1. temperature (as in REMD)
  2. umbrella sampling coordinate between center of mass of the two peptides
- Tests the approach on two peptide families:
  1. Tetrapeptides as minimal models for amyloid fibril formation
  2. fragment of a classic leucine zipper peptide and its mutant


see 38-46 for different applications of REMD to study the dimers, trimers etc for their stability.
see Wolf et al [66] for a replica exchange approach for sampling along a peptide-peptide distance coordinate.
