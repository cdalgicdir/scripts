# TO-DO
1. fix fig. 3 sas plots
2. enlarge fig. 3 sas plots
3. calculate helix sasa for hydrophobic sidechains (single value to compare with remaining sec str.s)
4. intra-hbond for kl1b
5. christoph: eala1b 800 ns snapshot to show the loop (and show the Hbond)
6. christoph: when does the molecule go to the interface eala1i
6. add kl1b intra-hbnum to SI
6. put kl2b climbing snapshots into SI
6. kl2b: sas-PLs1 and 2 on same fig instead of sasa fig
6. kl2b: calc intra-hbonds for each and place in SI
