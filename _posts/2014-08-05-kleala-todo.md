# TO-DO
1. ~~fix fig. 3 sas plots~~
2. ~~enlarge fig. 3 sas plots~~
3. ~~calculate helix sasa for hydrophobic sidechains (single value to compare with remaining sec str.s)~~ (kl: 7.86, eala: 4.18)
4. ~~intra-hbond for kl1b~~
5. ~~christoph: eala1b 800 ns snapshot to show the loop (and show the Hbond)~~
6. ~~christoph: when does the molecule go to the interface eala1i~~
7. ~~add kl1b intra-hbnum to SI~~
8. ~~put kl2b climbing snapshots into SI~~
9. ~~kl2b: sas-PLs1 and 2 on same fig instead of sasa fig~~
10. kl2b: calc intra-hbonds for each and place in SI
