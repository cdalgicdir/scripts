### SASA Calculations

#####Single peptide in bulk water:
```bash
echo Protein Protein | g_sas -f -s -n -dt 100 -o area-PP.xvg
```

#####Single peptide at air/water interface:
```bash
echo System Protein | g_sas -f -s -n -dt 100 -o area-SP.xvg
echo Protein Protein | g_sas -f -s -n -dt 100 -o area-PP.xvg
```
- difference between area-PP and area-SP (ie area-PP - area-SP) will give the water-exposed area.

#####Dimer in bulk water:
```bash
echo Protein Protein_chain1 | g_sas -f -s -n -dt 100 -o area-Pp1.xvg
```
- area-Pp1 will give the water-exposed area for chain 1

#####Dimer at air/water interface:
```bash
echo Protein Protein_chain1 | g_sas -f -s -n -dt 100 -o area-Pp1.xvg
echo System Protein_chain1 | g_sas -f -s -n -dt 100 -o area-Sp1.xvg
```
- area-Pp1 will give you the sum of the water-exposed area and the water-shielded area due to the interface (excluding the shielded area due to the 2nd chain)
- area-Sp1 will give you the water-shielded area due to the interface (excluding the shielded area due to 2nd chain)
- difference between area-Pp1 and area-Sp1 will give the water exposed area for chain 1

#### Further notes
- When we calculate the SASA values of a single KL peptide at air/water
interface, and use the command below (System as surface and protein as
calculation group), we get SASA of ~2-3 when the peptide is submerged in
bulk water. This SASA should be zero because we are calculating the area
of the protein above water, but the radius of the probe is small enough to
penetrate through water. Therefore I think we need to define the size of
the probe such that it will not take into account any contribution from
the area of the peptide inside the bulk water. For my case, a probe radius
of 0.21 nm yields zero SASA when the peptide is submerged in bulk water.
~~To be consistent I plan to use a probe size of 0.21 nm for all my SASA
calculations.~~
```bash
echo System Protein | g_sas -f -s -n -dt 100 -o area-SP.xvg
```

#### Further notes-2
```bash
echo System Protein | g_sas -f -s -n -o area-SP-p014 -q connelly-SP-p014 -dt 100 -e 500 -probe 0.14 -ndots 100
```
