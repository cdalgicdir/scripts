A single KL peptide has the same amount of exposure of the hydrophobic
leucine sidechains to the hydrophilic water molecules when it adopts
alpha-helix compared to the random-coil. Therefore in bulk water, the
alpha-helix does not have an overwhelming favor against the random-coil.

One should differentiate between different forms of random coils, e.g.
extended vs compact forms. Because in the compact form the exposure of
hydrophobic leucine sidechains to the hydrophilic water molecules is
reduced. Therefore there is no advantage of alpha-helix over the compact
form of random-coil.

This may be the reason behind various secondary structures of a single KL
peptide without an unique conformation in the bulk water. To this end,
the end to end distance of the peptide could be calculated for the random
coil structures and maybe correlated with the amount of water exposure of
the leucine sidechains. Initiating a fully extended coil in bulk water and
observing the change in its end to end distance and correlating this to
the amount of water exposure could give an insight into the factors for
conformational dynamics of the KL peptide.
