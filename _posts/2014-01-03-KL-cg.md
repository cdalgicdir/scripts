1. obtain bonded distributions for tetramer and compare with bonded distibutions for a single KL in vacuum
1. Fit bonded distributions (possibly for 1 peak where available)
1. Do a trial CG simulation for tetramer in implicit water using generic repulsive LJ for nonbonded
1. Then, do IBI and generate nonbonded potentials
