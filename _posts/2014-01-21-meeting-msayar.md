TO DO:
1. For REMD analysis add DSSP data for each replica for both bw and interface
2. AH ratio vs T: do block averaging: are the differences significant
3. For dimer PMF of bw and int: do block averaging
4. Add snapshots of each basin for the dimer
5. Better match for dimer PMF anti-par vs Boltzmann-invert of free
6. Aggregate PMF: repulsion at large distances?
7. For dimer, why is there so much difference with increasing time? (especially for the dimer)
8. Add the second free dimer at interface simulation data: esp distance vs angle

Questions:
1. Why is the tetramer most stable?
2. Is the repulsion for aggregates at large distances in PMFs real?
3. Why is the 3rd basin for dimer most stable? (possible answer: charge-charge repulsion)
